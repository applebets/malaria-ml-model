# Machine Learning Model for Malaria Diagnosis

## Overview
A **TensorFlow 2 binary classification model** trained on the NIH Malaria Cell Image Dataset  
to distinguish between **infected** and **non-infected red blood cells**.

## Features
- Preprocessing and data augmentation  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture  
- Accuracy evaluation on validation set  

## Results
✅ Achieved reliable classification accuracy on test samples  
⚠️ Requires more training data for clinical-level reliability  

## Future Directions
- Model optimization for mobile/low-power devices  
- Integration with Raspberry Pi for **point-of-care diagnostics**  
- Expansion to other blood-borne diseases
